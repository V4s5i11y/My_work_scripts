Hi, this is a portfolio/work repository where I upload simple scripts, that I made during my education. 

All of these tools are intended for authorized penetration testing purposes only.

Nice to meet you, Vas.

Description: 

* Auto_spoof - enables IP forwarding and spoofs the connection between target host and the router, based on arpspoof tool.
  
* php_extention_copier - Sometimes while probing for server-side filtering you need to check several filename extensions - this script creates copies of the payload with different php filename extensions. (need to update)
  
* subdom.sh - find subdomains

* ip_sweep - simple network discover tool
