Hi, welcome to my portfolio/work repository! Here, I upload various simple scripts I created during my education. Some of these scripts are by other authors that I like and keep here for later use.

All of these tools are intended for authorized penetration testing purposes only.

Nice to meet you, Vas.

Description: 

* Auto_spoof - enables IP forwarding and spoofs the connection between target host and the router, based on arpspoof tool.
  
* php_extention_copier - Sometimes while probing for server-side filtering you need to check several filename extensions - this script creates copies of the payload with different php filename extensions. (need to update)
  
* subdom.sh - find subdomains

* ip_sweep - simple network discover tool

* breachad_config.sh - script which will prepare VPN connection and DNS for working with tryhackme room "Breaching Active Directory"
